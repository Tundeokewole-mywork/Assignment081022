  He started and completed his elementary education at St. Mary’s RCM Special School, Oke-Ogunbade,

  admission to study Political Science and Social Studies (Pol/Sos) at Emmanuel Alayande College of
  Education and graduated in 2008. Because of his passion and skills for teaching, he decided to go for a
  teaching job,and worked as a Government subject teacher for two years at Winners International
  College, Isale-Oyo, Oyo. In 2010, he gained admission to study Sociology at the prestigious University of
  Ibadan, Ibadan and graduated in 2015. Immediately after completing the compulsory National Youth Service
  Corps (NYSC) programme, which was done in Maradun, Zamfara state, he gained admission to pursue

  every opportunity that presents itself. He is openly taciturn but likes to live happily amid people who
  like to joke a lot. He demonstrates <i>Scorpio</i> attributes and likes to meet new people, irrespective of
  personality. He is accommodating but quickly dissociates himself from people with a habit of faking
  reality or hypocrisy.He very careful of what he eats and would do anything to avoid unhealthy diets.

    <li>Orange,</li>
    <li>Apple and</li>
    <li>Banana.</li>
  </ol>
  He likes footbal game a lot and this formed his childhood identity in the whole of Iseyin where he grew up. Even as adult,
  he continues to show his love for football by watching both local and international footbal matches.
  His favourite English team is <a>Chelsea fc.</a></p>
  <p>
    He is very responsible, and he would do everything possible to assist people in need or less privileged.
  In demonstrating his willingness to serve people, he took up leadership positions in many of the
  institutions he passed through. He was a punctuality prefect in his final year in primary school. He
  served as a student union representative at different levels, which included as Political Science
  Students Association (POSA) President in 2008. During his undergraduate days, he served as the class
  representative from the first year to the final year, when he occupied the position of Nigerian
  Sociological and Anthropological Science Association (NSASA) President in 2014. Before that, he had
  served as the Clerk for the House, Independence Hall, at the University of Ibadan in 2012. Also, he
  served as the National President of the Federation of Iseyin Local Government Students (FILGS) in
  2013. He was able to combine academic and extracurricular activities because of his doggedness,
  intellect, and brilliance. He demonstrated tenacity and a love for research, which earned him a
  distinction for his MSc. Project. During his NYSC programme in Maradun, Zamfara state, he was
  appointed the Corpers Liaison Officer (CLO), and he demonstrated his leadership dexterity well with
  monumental projects credited to his administration.</p>
  <p>
    Tunde would always demonstrate his love for knowledge and skills. He has three articles published in
  both local and international journals. He built on the little exposure he had to statistics and developed
  his skills in data analysis using SPSS. This is a skill that made him competitive among other fresh
  graduates at the time he finished his second degree. Hence, he was favoured by a few research job
  opportunities in which he was called to team up with other senior researchers as an assistant
  researcher in the Department of Sociology, at the University of Ibadan between 2017 and 2019. The
  junior research job allowed him to build a lasting relationship with and learn from lecturers and
  professors in the field of research.</p>
  <p>
    In 2019, he joined a consultancy firm as a training and research officer. He participated and took a
  lead role in conducting several national consultancy assignments and development research before
  leaving the firm in July 2022, exactly after three years of service. Most of the consultancy assignments
  he worked to implement included playing the roles of designing research, designing a survey, and
  qualitative instruments for data collection, coordinating fieldwork, data analysis, report writing, and
  presentation. His love for working with data to draw insights for making policy or management
  decisions was well known to everybody in the organisation. Tunde will not let any opportunity to
  acquire more knowledge and skills in data management slip from his hands. Thus, he is excited when
  he learns the application of new technologies and techniques to working with data.</p>
  <p>
    While his penchant to acquire more educational qualifications and a dynamic <a href="C:\Users\OWNER\Desktop\My profile documents\CVs\Training and Development manager resume.docx">profile</a>
  never dwindles, he would lie to tailor
  such towards more profitable trends and respectable skills with future relevance. He pursues this to
  fulfil his long-term goal in life, which is to create an impact on the community and the nation at large
  by initiating and participating in designing development policies, programmes, and projects. He
  believes society is better only if there is social justice, respect for people, and equal life chances for
  everybody. Thus, his life revolves around the promotion of peace, welfare, and personal and
  group/community development.</p>
  <p>
    His philosophy &nbsp; of life is that human life is dependent on the interplay of spiritual law, natural law, and
  social laws. Humans have to discover the self by gaining an in-depth understanding of the trio to be
  able to discover the self and achieve a meaningful existence. This means people should sit at the
  epicentre of the three or maintain equilibrium among the three. One must be spiritually strong, be
  familiar with nature, and maintain a good social relationship with people. The three come together to
  define a person and determine the essence of life. Having limited knowledge of any of the three wil
  stifle personal growth and development.</p>
